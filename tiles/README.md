# From cert.ccc.de with love
This are our over 250 individual tiles/sprites for the rc3 workadventure.

* Composed tilesets are located in imgs/tilesheets
* Sets ending with _set are deprecated, please don't use them anymore.


## check_imgs.py
We strongly recommend using this script as pre-commit script.
It checks all image dimensions and compiles a tilesheet for every directory if wanted.


# Usage
We recommend to use our compiled tilesheets instead of picking indivual sprites, but it's up to you.
They are safe to use, no existing tiles will me replaced or moved inside the sheet.

## cert_safety
We provide a special cert_safety tileset for everyone to keep their virtual space as safe as possible.
Properly secured world may be CERTified by us.
